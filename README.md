Fast turbo boost switch for 15ARH05

It's a simple .bat file for fast switch between performance modes on Lenovo notebooks with AMD Ryzen CPU, technicaly, it's just change PERFBOOSTMODE parameter between 0 and 1.
By that script, you can change CPU clock from 3.0 Ghz to 4.0 Ghz and back by enabling/disabling turbo boost mode without opening Control Panel and changing registry files manualy.

Tested on Lenovo Ideapad 3 15ARH05 with Ryzen 5 4600H, OS Windows 11.
